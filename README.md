# Armadillo Game Engine
A command line only output game engine designed to be simple and understandable extremely heavily influenced by Unity.
 
With user input, rapid console renderer and integrated mini debug console this game engine is a perfect start for budding game developers.

Simple to understand structure and making the engine itself easily 'tinkerable' are the core values for this project.
